This is a WIP terminal client for Discord, written in nodejs.

## Configuration
The file `config.ini` contains some of the crucial information for this client. These are the keys and their values to the client:
- `token`: (string) your user token for Discord, used to log in as you
- `unicode`: (boolean) whether or not to try and render unicode symbols in the client
- `prefix`: (string) the prefix for commands, though in this fork commands aren't present (yet!)
