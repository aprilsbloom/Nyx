# To-do
- [ ] Add direct messages support, possibly voice support in the future as well considering ```discord.js-selfbot-v13``` supports it.
- [ ] Add ability to navigate previously sent messages in the chat to reply, delete or edit.
- [ ] Add user role color, unsure if that'll be able to be done but I'll try.
- [ ] Add centered timestamps so that old messages aren't clumped together when a channel is inactive.
