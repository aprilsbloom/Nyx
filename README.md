# Discord Terminal Client
This is a work in progress terminal client for Discord written in JavaScript.

# To-do
I have partially implemented blessed (a TUI framework) into this, but I will continue to add to it. 

I have only implemented this in the server UI.

- [x] Server list
- [x] Channel list
- [x] Message listener
- [x] Sending messages
- [ ] Showing attachment URLs
